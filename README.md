## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
  The variables and coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are  the Vehicle Length, the Vehicle Width, and Ground Clearance. This is because the three factors' P-Value is less than .05.
  
  The slope of the linear model is not zero because of the p-value, which is 5.35.
  
  The model will be effective in predicting the MPG at 71% of the time. 29% of tyhe time it will fail to predict the data adequately. This is still substantially better than other methods of prediction.
